- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GonzalezVirginia
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in maybe getting some insight through your site...
-A person that I know hacked into my account and it's very involved with this site. 
Not only did they hack into my phone, my computers, my TVs and Bluetooth speakers, 
But the creator was able to create content on social media and tailor my content.
I am not too tech savvy, but I really thought something weird was going on.
For example on TickTock I can recognize every single background of where footage is 
being take, however the people on screen I don't know them and it almost seems like they are
A clone to someone famous. I'm not sure if this person replicates someone famous on TickTock YouTube etc.
Then intern hacks their followers for financial gain or something around those lines. 
I could not get rid of this hacker so I decided to sync our information together. 
I got a bunch of coding JSON codes. I took video and screenshots of it but not sure
What it is maybe someone can help me ?? All I want is a hacker to stop and go away or 
where can I report him or her ? 
 ðŸ“« How to reach me .. Virginia.aggeguin@gmail.com 

Not sure how the site works but I'll attach whatever I have as far as pictures and please feel free to contact me I'll send 
The video. 
If anyone is interested in more information you can contact me. 
What I do see is a lot of software engineers listed not sure if that was their contribution I am not sure.
